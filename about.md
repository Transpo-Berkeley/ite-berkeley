Cal Transportation Team was founded in 2016. We compete in the ASCE Mid-Pacific Transportation competition, planning and designing a solution to a given prompt. The team has many members from different backgrounds working on planning, operations, and design of transportation systems. The team also runs a DeCal class so students can get academic credit for their work.
