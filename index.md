# Join Us

Our team welcomes all interested students! We welcome more than just civil engineers; our current team consists of members from a variety of other disciplines.

### ðŸ“š Learn New Skills

Designers on the team work together in AutoCAD, a vital software used in engineering but not taught by many classes. Team members who work in operations learn how to use Synchro and Vissim to model traffic conditions, just like consultants in the field. Cal Transportation Team allows its members to get hands-on experience with professional software through in-class workshops.

### ðŸ’¼ Industry Connections and Resources

Joining Cal Transportation team provides valuable connections within the transportation industry. Our current advisors work in prestigious research institutes, innovative agencies, and private firms. These connections and the work experience provided by the project make our students competitive candidates for internships and entry level positions.
